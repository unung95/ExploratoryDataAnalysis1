##Introduction

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

- Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
- Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
- Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
- Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
- Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
- Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
- Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
- Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

## Data

- The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. 
- Only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. 
- Converting the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the as.Date() and as.POSIXct() functions.
- Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?.

## Plots

- R script save with plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R
- For security reason, file upload using create new issues.
- Image file accessed with plot1.png.md, plot2.png.md, plot3.png.md, plot4.png.md
